    <!--
        X Make UI so player can play with buttons, not console.
        X For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds.
        X Create three buttons, one for each selection. 
            X Add event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct 
              playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.logs for 
              this step)
        X Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.logs into DOM methods.
        - Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 
          5 points.
        
        - Once you’re all done with your UI and made sure everything’s satisfactory, commit your 
          changes to the rps-ui branch.
